Webpage displays main page of a service where you can buy photoshoots in different locations.

Design choice:
I decided to go with the light theme to catch the user by themes like innocence and freedom, which I think would suit photography website

Bootstrap implementatuion & difficulties faced:
Before creating content i put some links for bootstrap in the head tag; however, these links turned out to be outdated and with new features they didnt work. I spent an hour trying to figure that out
I found myself not really relying on bootstrap classes for styling, as they offer less option.
